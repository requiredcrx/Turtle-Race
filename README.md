# Turtle Race

This is the "Turtle Race" project, where turtles of different colors compete in a race. Users can place bets on which turtle they think will win the race.

## Description

The program uses the turtle module to create a turtle race simulation. The turtles start from the left side of the screen and race towards the right side. The first turtle to reach the right side is declared the winner.

Before the race starts, users are prompted to make a bet by choosing a turtle color. If the user's chosen turtle wins the race, they win the bet; otherwise, they lose.

# How to Run the Program

+ Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
+ Copy the provided code into a Python file (e.g., "turtle_race.py").
+ Run the Python file using a Python interpreter or an integrated development environment (IDE).
+ The turtle race window will open, and you will be prompted to enter your bet by choosing a turtle color.
+ After making your bet, the race will start, and you will see the turtles moving towards the right side of the screen.
+ Once a turtle reaches the right side, the race will stop, and the outcome of the race will be displayed in the console.
+ Close the turtle race window and the console when you are done.

## Acknowledgments

This project is a simple implementation of a turtle race simulation using the turtle module in Python. It provides a fun way to interact with the program by placing bets on the outcome of the race.

**Note:** The outcome of the race is determined by random distances moved by each turtle, making each race unique.
